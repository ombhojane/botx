# twitter-bot
im bored of shitposting on x , this few lines of code will do it for me starting today


So how it works i simple small guide . 

STEP 1 - cd botx bun i bun run dev
STEP 2 - copy example env and make your own env , add your x api keys
STEP 3 - change the prompt as per your personality or use case
STEP 4 - deploy on vercel , 
` in vercel.json it has number of times it will post , currently it has 1 post per day , but u can increase it by changing vercel.json` 
but vercel hobby plan only allows 1 cron hit per day

step 5 - if u want to tweet more than once just hit the post api through curl or postman or make a form idk just hit the request , of the url the vercel will give u /api/tweet but a post request
